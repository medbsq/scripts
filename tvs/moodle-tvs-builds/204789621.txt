    The web-component-tester node module is not installed as a dependency of
    this project (iron-fit-behavior).

    We recommend that you run this command to add it:
        npm install --save-dev web-component-tester

    or run:
        yarn add web-component-tester --dev

    Doing so will ensure that your project is in control of the version of wct
    that your project is tested with, insulating you from any future breaking
    changes and making your test runs more reproducible. In a future release
    of wct this will be required.
